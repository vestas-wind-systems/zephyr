  Properties supporting Zephyr SPI-NAND flash driver (over the Zephyr SPI
  API) control of serial flash memories using the standard command set.

compatible: "jedec,spi-nand"

include: [spi-device.yaml]

properties:
  jedec-id:
    type: uint8-array
    required: true
    description: JEDEC ID

  size-bytes:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: flash capacity in bytes

  erase-block-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Address alignment required by flash erase operations. Equivalent to
      the block size for SPI NAND flash storage.

  write-block-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Address alignment required by flash write operations. Equivalent to
      the page size for SPI NAND flash storage.

  block-erase-duration-max:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Maximum erase duration of a block in microseconds.

  page-program-duration-max:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Maximum page program duration in microseconds.

  page-read-duration-max:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Maximum page read duration in microseconds.

  reset-duration-max:
    type: int
    default: 2000
    description: |
      Maximum reset duration in microseconds. Default is larger than the
      maximum values for sample Macronix (500 us) and Micron (1250 us)
      devices.
