  Zephyr W1 GPIO node

  This defines a one-wire driver through GPIO bit-banging.

  Implementation details:
    - Most drivers require the selected gpio to support open drain, this enables onewire
      devices to lower the signal when the SOC set the signal high.
    - Ensure pullup is strong enough (4.7K according to the specification). Standard pullup in
      SOC are usually weak, and may not be strong enough.

compatible: "zephyr,w1-gpio"

include: [w1-master.yaml]

                   /* Configure pin as open-drain with internal pull-up resistor. */
                   gpios = <&gpio0 13 (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN | GPIO_PULL_UP)>;
           };
