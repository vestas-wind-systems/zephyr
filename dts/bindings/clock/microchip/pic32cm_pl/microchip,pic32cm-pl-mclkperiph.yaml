title: PIC32CM_PL MCLK (Main Clock) peripheral

description: |
  Main Clock Controller provides synchronous system clocks to the modules
  connected to the AHBx and the APBx buses.

include: [base.yaml]

  "#clock-cells":

      The subsystem cell is to identify a clock controller sub-system.

      The subsystem can be referred from include\zephyr\dt-bindings\clock\mchp_pic32cm_pl_clock.h,
      under the MCLKPERIPH_TYPE section of ids.
      All clock control API use this value to specify the clock on which the API operates.
      Since subsystem is opaque to the user, it can be accessed from the devicetree node and used.
