description: |
  Board GPIO power rails binding for Modular Embedded Controller cards that are connected to
  Intel RVP and get power from it.
  Provides GPIOs involved in eSPI controller-target handshake also known as power sequencing.
  Intended for use in board device trees where power rail status and ready signaling are required.

properties:
  pwrg-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      Board GPIO input(s) used to detect that power rails are stable.

  rsm-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      Board GPIO output(s) used to notify the controller/target that power has
      stabilized and minimum initialization is complete, so the controller/target
      can proceed with further handshake or initialization.
